# BabyConversation
Enjoy a fun "interrogation" with a baby with totally random questions that only babies can ask. Using a random.choice, this program will pose a random question to the user and using a while loop, the baby will keep asking "why?" until the user responds to the question with "just because". Enjoy! :) 

##Steps To Run This Program a. You need to have python installed on your computer.
b. Clone this repository on your local machine. c. Double-click on baby.py
